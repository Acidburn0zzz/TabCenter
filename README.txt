Vertical Tabs for Firefox 3.7
=============================

This Firefox add-on arranges tabs in a vertical rather than horizontal
fashion.  It is heavily inspired by and borrows ideas from the excellent
Tree Style Tab add-on.

Goals:

* Arrange tabs in groups (instead of arbitrary trees)

* Some group-related features (collapse group, tab previews, etc.)

* Very few other features and hopefully little or no preference settings

* Native look and feel

* Readable and maintainable code, taking latest Mozilla practices into
  account.  No eval() hacks.
